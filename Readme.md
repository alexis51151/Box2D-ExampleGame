JIN course game

What is it ? 
------------
Just a simple platform game where two players are linked with a rope and have to get out of hell avoiding its many monsters.

What is the game engine ?
---------------------
To display graphics, we're currently using Box2D engine which gives pretty good results, the only drawback being the rope. Indeed, its actions can sometimes be... quite surprising to say the least !

Any next plans ?
----------------

- Add more levels
- Debug the rope (use other types of links with Box2D)
- Create a menu
